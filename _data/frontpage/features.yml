- title: MRView
  description: |
    A modern, full-featured viewer to display images and results efficiently
    and intuitively.

- title: Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)
  description: |
    The current standard for estimating the Fibre Orientation Distribution (FOD).
    CSD inherently handles crossing fibres and dispersion.

- title: Multi-Shell Multi-Tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD)
  description: |
    Provided with multi-shell data, MSMT-CSD resolves partial volume between tissue types.
    The resulting WM FOD is not distorted by other tissues.

- title: Robust FOD-based tractography
  description: |
    State-of-the-art high-performance tracking algorithms, including probabilistic
    2nd order integration over FODs, generating millions of tracks in minutes.

- title: FOD-based DEC maps and panchromatic sharpening
  description: |
    Robust FOD-based colours, solving issues of DTI-based DEC FA.
    Pansharpening for the best of both worlds: FOD-based DEC and anatomy-based spatial features.

- title: Anatomically Constrained Tractography (ACT)
  description: |
    Effective use of anatomical information, built right into the tracking framework;
    an essential basis for biologically meaningful connectomics.

- title: SIFT for meaningful connectivities
  description: |
    Designed to ensure streamline counts provide good estimates of white matter
    connectivity.

- title: Structural Connectomics
  description: |
    Use state-of-the-art reconstruction tools to construct structural connectomes, and
    visualize them directly in MRtrix.

- title: Image registration for diffusion MRI
  description: |
    Designed explicitly for inter-subject alignment of fibre orientation distributions
    as provided by CSD and variants.

- title: Fixel-based analysis
  description: |
    Next-generation analysis technique for group analysis of diffusion MRI
    data, enabling statistical inference at the level of individual fibre populations within a voxel (fixel).

- title: Global Tractography
  description: |
    Full-brain track reconstruction that matches the apparent fibre density (AFD) in multi-shell DWI data,
    based on the new multi-tissue spherical convolution paradigm.

- title: Track Weighted Imaging framework
  description: |
    Several mechanisms to map distributions of tracks to image grids, including
    Track Density Imaging (TDI) and Track Orientation Density Imaging (TODI).

- title: Seamless interaction with main image formats
  description: |
    All MRtrix programs work directly with DICOM (read only), NIfTI, Analyze
    and MRtrix' native image format.

- title: Cross-platform
  description: |
    Runs natively on Linux, MacOSX and Windows.

- title: Command-line driven for flexibility
  description: |
    Most applications are command-line driven to allow easy scripting and fully
    exploit the expressive power of the command-line interpreter.
