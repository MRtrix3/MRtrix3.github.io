- title: MRView
  description: |
    A modern, full-featured viewer to display images and results efficiently
    and intuitively.

- title: Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)
  description: |
    The current standard for estimating the Fibre Orientation Distribution (FOD).
    CSD inherently handles crossing fibres and dispersion.

- title: Multi-Shell Multi-Tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD)
  description: |
    Provided with multi-shell data, MSMT-CSD resolves partial volume between tissue types.
    The resulting WM FOD is not distorted by other tissues.

- title: Tractography framework
  description: |
    Several robust and high-performance tracking algorithms, including
    recent additions such as Anatomically Constrained Tractography (ACT).

- title: SIFT for meaningful connectivities
  description: |
    Designed to ensure streamline counts provide good estimates of white matter
    connectivity.

- title: Structural Connectomics
  description: |
    Use state-of-the-art reconstruction tools to construct structural connectomes, and
    visualize them directly in MRtrix.

- title: Image registration for diffusion MRI
  description: |
    Designed explicitly for inter-subject alignment of fibre orientation distributions
    as provided by CSD and variants.

- title: Fixel-based analysis
  description: |
    Next-generation analysis technique for group analysis of diffusion MRI
    data, enabling statistical inference at the level of individual fibre populations within a voxel (fixel).

- title: Global Tractography
  description: |
    Full-brain track reconstruction that matches the apparent fibre density (AFD) in multi-shell DWI data,
    based on the new multi-tissue spherical convolution paradigm.

- title: Command-line driven for flexibility
  description: |
    Most applications are command-line driven to allow easy scripting and fully
    exploit the expressive power of the command-line interpreter.

- title: Cross-platform
  description: |
    Runs natively on Linux, MacOSX and Windows.
