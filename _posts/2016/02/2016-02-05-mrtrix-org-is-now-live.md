MRtrix3 now has a new [website](http://www.mrtrix.org)! After some earlier struggles, we have switched to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for improved security and simpler content management. 

This site will act as a central portal for the various MRtrix3-related activities:

- [downloading and installing MRtrix3](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/wiki#supported-platforms--installation) 
- the [wiki for user documentation](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/wiki)
- the [forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/) for user support 
- the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues) to submit and
  follow up on bug reports
- the [code](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3) and its version history
- the [developer documentation](/developer-documentation/) for those wanting to extend MRtrix3 or write their own applications
- other news, demonstrations, screenshots, etc., which we will hopefully build up over time.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, bits of news (e.g. MRtrix3 in the press), nice screenshots, etc., get in touch!

Cheers,
Donald
