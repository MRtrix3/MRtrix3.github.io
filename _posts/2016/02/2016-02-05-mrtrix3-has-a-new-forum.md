We have set up a [new forum for MRtrix3](http://community.mrtrix.org/), which we hope will provide a much better experience for our users than the [current Google+ community page](https://plus.google.com/communities/111072048088633408015). This new forum is powered by [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/), and provides vastly improved features. You should be able to log in using either your Google or GitHub credentials. Please take a look, and ask any questions you may have on this forum.

Thanks especially to Dave Raffelt and Rami Tabbara for their efforts in
putting this together.
