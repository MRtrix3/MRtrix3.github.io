MRtrix3 now has a new website! After some earlier struggles, we have switched
to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for improved security and simpler
content management. 

This site will act as a central portal for the various MRtrix3-related
activities:

- [downloading and installing
  MRtrix3](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/wiki#supported-platforms--installation) 
- the [wiki for user documentation](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/wiki)
- the [forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/) for user support 
- the [issue tracker](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues) to submit and
  follow up on bug reports
- the [code](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3) and its version history
- the [developer
  documentation](http://mrtrix3.github.io/developer-documentation/) for those
wanting to extend MRtrix3 or write their own applications
- other news, demonstrations, screenshots, etc., which we will hopefully build up
  over time.

If you have any feedback, suggestions, bits of news (e.g. MRtrix3 in the
press), nice screenshots, etc., get in touch!
