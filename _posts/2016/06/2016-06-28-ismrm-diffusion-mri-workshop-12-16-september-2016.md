The next [ISMRM Diffusion MRI Workshop](http://www.ismrm.org/workshops/Diffusion16)  _"Breaking Barriers in Diffusion MRI"_ is coming up! This will be held in Lisbon, Portugal, on September 12-16. It's a great forum to meet and share ideas with each other and leaders in the field. We hope to see many of you there!



#### Full details:

* Dates: September 12-16, 2016
* Venue: Sheraton Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal
* Deadline for abstracts: July 21, 2016
* Registration is now officially open
* Website: http://www.ismrm.org/workshops/Diffusion16


As with the first three workshops held in 2002, 2005 and 2013, the workshop has been designed as the primary scientific venue for basic scientists and clinical researchers in the diffusion MR community to learn, meet the experts, discuss the latest advances in the field, and network. There is an optional bootcamp for trainees and those new to the field of diffusion MR on September 12. The formal scientific program from September 13-16 will cover the full scope of diffusion MR topics from acquisition to microstructure and modeling, anatomy, tractography, connectomics, validation, clinical application, and future strategies for innovation.

Whether you are new to the field, a PhD student, postdoc, senior researcher or physician, we hope that you will be able to participate in the workshop and interact with the leaders in the field. **Please note that the deadline for scientific abstract submission is July 21, 2016**.
