Hi all,

For those of you based in Australia or New Zealand, you may (hopefully?) have received notice that there is a diffusion MRI workshop occurring on Friday July 30, which will include yours truly doing a 90-minute interactive workshop session intended for an intermediate-advanced audience. Obviously being interactive, coming from me, and with a large volume of *MRtrix3* development work having originated from Australia, it will have a strong *MRtrix3* component; and because there's a beginner session running in parallel, it's an opportunity for me to get into some meatier topics.

One thing we have learned from the software workshops we have run thus far is that it is typically audience questions that spawn the most interesting and insightful discussions, exposing things like relatively unknown software capabilities, intrinsic assumptions in data processes that could be violated in certain circumstances, techniques for debugging or diagnosing, etc.. It would be awesome if some **ANZ *MRtrix3* users have burning questions that could be pre-registered**, so that I can determine ahead of time which of them constitute rabbit holes that are deserving of a wider audience, and therefore help me plan out 90 minutes of content.

(There will be the opportunity to ask questions on-the-fly, of course; but my anxiety will be thankful for your promptitude!)
