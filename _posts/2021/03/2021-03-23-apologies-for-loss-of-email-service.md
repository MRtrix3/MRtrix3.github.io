Hi everyone, 

We've just discovered that email notifications have not been sent out as expected since we performed the last forum software update on 11 March. This has now been rectified, and you should now be getting emails notifications normally again. We encourage you to have a quick look for any relevant activity you may have missed over the last 12 days.

It seems this was due to a change in the default value for the relevant configuration option in the software we use to host the forum -- a change that has also affected other projects ([details here for the interested reader](https://meta.discourse.org/t/mailing-list-mode-mysteriously-deactivated/182650)).

Our apologies for any inconvenience caused. 
All the best, 

The MRtrix3 team.
