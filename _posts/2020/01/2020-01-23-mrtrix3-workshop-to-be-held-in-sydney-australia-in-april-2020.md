Hi everyone,

We are pleased to announce that will be hosting our next official  *MRtrix3*  workshop in April in Sydney, Australia. This will be held immediately prior to the [ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/20m/), and hosted at [NeuRA](https://www.neura.edu.au/). While we are currently finalising the details of the event, we are making the announcement now to allow potential attendees to plan ahead. We will make a more official announcement in the next few weeks, at which point users will be able to register.

In the meantime, the current plan is:

* **date & time:**  Tuesday 14 till Friday 17 April 2020
* **location:**  [Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA)](https://www.neura.edu.au/), [139 Barker St, Randwick NSW 2031, Australia](https://goo.gl/maps/ZboJpV66tkAsrYYJ9)
* **attendance:**  up to 60 delegates
* **cost:**   AU$ 1000 / 1500 / 2000 per person for student / academic / non-academic attendees.  As a guide, this equates to (approx):
   - US$ 685 / 1000 / 1370 
   - € 620 / 930 / 1230 
   - £ 525 / 790 / 1050
* **includes**: laptop, venue hire, coffee breaks, lunches, and a welcome dinner, but *excludes*  accommodation.

We hope to see many of you there! Watch this space for further announcements.

All the best,

The  *MRtrix3*  team
