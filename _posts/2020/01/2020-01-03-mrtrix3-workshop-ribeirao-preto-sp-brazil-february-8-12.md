We are pleased to announce (somewhat belatedly!) that our 3rd _MRtrix3_ Workshop will be held in Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil from February 8th to 12th, 2020. This is the first edition away from Europe, and will be part of the [InBrain Workshop: Advanced Brain Imaging](https://www.inbrainlab.com/workshop), an ISMRM endorsed event.

We hope to see many of you there!

All the best, 

The *MRtrix3*  team.
