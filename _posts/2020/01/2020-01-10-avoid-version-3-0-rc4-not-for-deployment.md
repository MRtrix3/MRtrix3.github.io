Hi all, 

It's come to my attention that [users have been installing the version tagged as `3.0_RC4`](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/1834) on GitHub. **Please avoid this version**, it was not intended for external use. I offer my sincere apologies for any confusion or inconvenience to those this has already affected, it was a thoughtless mistake on my part.

For further details on how this happened, see the [corresponding issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/1834).

My apologies once again, and all the best,
Donald.
