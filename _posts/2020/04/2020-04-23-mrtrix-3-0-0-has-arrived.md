![release](https://community.mrtrix.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/72f721cb630e57b9cded13c39cd0870e649554a0.jpeg) 

**We are pleased to announce the immediate full release of *MRtrix* 3.0.0** - our first production release! :partying_face:

This is the culmination of many years of work, and brings a large number of improvements and bug fixes. In particular, we now provide pre-compiled packages to ease the installation process across all main platforms -- you'll find instructions for this on the [main website's downloads page](https://www.mrtrix.org/download/).

We recommend existing users upgrade as soon as practical. This can be done using the [newly-provided packages](https://www.mrtrix.org/download/), or using the [usual procedure for source installations](http://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/installation/build_from_source.html#keeping-mrtrix3-up-to-date), with an additional call to  `configure` (instructions here assuming that you have previously been using the default `git` branch "`master`"):

```
git pull
./configure
./build
```

See [here for the full (and very long) changelog](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/mrtrix-3-0-rc3-3-0-0-changelog/3552). 

All the best from the  *MRtrix3*  team!
