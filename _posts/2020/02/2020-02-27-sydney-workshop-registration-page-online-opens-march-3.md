The Australian National Imaging Facility ([NIF](https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/gmbSCVAGLrsxLGQlkSGeTz0?domain=anif.org.au)) is a partner to the Characterisation Data enhanced Virtual Laboratory (CDeVL) project, leading the training activities for FAIR principles of data sharing (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). As part of their mandate to support Australian researchers open access to research infrastructure, NIF has provided a financial contribution to the execution of the  *MRtrix3*  workshop, enabling a *reduction of the workshop registration fees* relative to our [preliminary announcement](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/mrtrix3-workshop-to-be-held-in-sydney-australia-in-april-2020/3223/2).

In addition, the Characterisation Virtual Laboratory ([CVL](https://www.cvl.org.au/)) is offering up to ten $500 scholarships to Australian registrants to assist with the costs of attending the workshop. Student and academic registrants from Australia are eligible to apply, with scholarships awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and a final closing date of March 23. Further details and instructions can be found [here](https://characterisation-virtual-laboratory.github.io/CVL_Community/scholarships/).

*Note: While the [registration page](https://www.neura.edu.au/event/mrtrix3-software-workshop/) currently advertises that these scholarships are specifically for travel, with only Australian registrants outside of NSW being eligible, this has been revised in consulatation with CVL such that ALL Australian registrants are eligible for these scholarships; the registration page will be updated imminently.*

We hope to have many of you signing up in the near future!

All the best,

The  *MRtrix3*  team
