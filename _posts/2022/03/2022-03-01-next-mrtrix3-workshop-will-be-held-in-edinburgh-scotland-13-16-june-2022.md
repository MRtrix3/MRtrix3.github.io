Hi everyone,

We are pleased to announce that will be hosting our fourth official *MRtrix3* workshop in June in Edinburgh, Scotland. Note that this is the week prior to the annual meeting of the OHBM in Glasgow, which just a short train ride away. 

While we are currently finalising the details of the event, we are making the announcement now to allow potential attendees to plan ahead. We will make a more official announcement in the next few weeks, at which point users will be able to register.

In the meantime, the current plan is:

- **date & time:** Monday 13 till Thursday 16 June 2022, 9am -- 5pm.
- **location:** [South Hall Complex, Pollock Halls](https://goo.gl/maps/YLjM9BUcAEkqecUHA), University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
- **attendance:** 60-100 delegates.
- **cost:** *predicted* to be £500 / £750 / £1000 for per person for student / academic / industry attendees. This will include venue hire, coffee breaks, lunches, and a welcome dinner, but will *exclude* accommodation.

We hope to see many of you there! Watch this space for further announcements. All the best,

The MRtrix3 team.
