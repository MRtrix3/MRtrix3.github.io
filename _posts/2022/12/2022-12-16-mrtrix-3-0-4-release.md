We are pleased to announce the immediate release of *MRtrix* `3.0.4`.

This is a bug fix release -- this should not affect ongoing studies, other than in exceptionally rare circumstances. We recommend users upgrade as soon as practical, using the instructions provided on our [downloads pages ](https://www.mrtrix.org/download/) (for precompiled packages), or the [usual procedure ](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.4/installation/build_from_source.html#keeping-mrtrix3-up-to-date) for installations from source.

See the [full changelog below](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/mrtrix-3-0-4-release/6263/2) for details.
 

All the best from the *MRtrix3* team!
