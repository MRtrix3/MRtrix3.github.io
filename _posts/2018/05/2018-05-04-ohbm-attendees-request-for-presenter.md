Hello everyone, 

I apologise for the somewhat unusual request, but we need your help. We've been invited to present _MRtrix3_ at the next meeting of the OHBM in Singapore, in the Open Science Room that will be run by the [Open Science SIG](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3712). We'd obviously really like to take this opportunity to showcase our latest and greatest, but unfortunately all of us developers will be in Paris at the time, attending the ISMRM and our own [MRtrix3 workshop](http://www.mrtrix.org/2018/01/30/announcing-the-first-mrtrix3-workshop-paris-june-22-24/) immediately thereafter (still a few places left, by the way :wink:). 

I am therefore putting out a call to all _MRtrix3_ users planning on attending the OHBM in Singapore this June: if you're confident and willing to deliver our presentation, we'd like to hear from you! We would obviously provide the slides, so hopefully this shouldn't require much effort on your part -- but you may get a few hard questions from the audience... 

Please contact the @workshop group on this forum to express your interest. 

Thanks for your support!
All the best,

Donald.
