**To all users registered for the upcoming MRtrix3 workshop in Paris:**

We look forward to welcoming you in Paris! We have put together what we hope will be an interesting and stimulating programme to demonstrate as much of the software as possible. 

With less than 2 weeks to go, it's time to go over some of the details of the event:

- Time & place: **[Hotel Mercure Paris Porte de Versailles](https://goo.gl/maps/uGHsz1nADMQ2), starting at 9am on Friday 22 June**, closing at 2pm on Sunday 24 June. We will be there to welcome you from 8:30am to ensure a prompt start.

- Don't forget that **you will each be provided with a laptop**, fully loaded with all the required software and lots of data. No need to bring your own laptop or data (although you are welcome to do so if you wish). 

- The [Unix command-line tutorial](http://command-line-tutorial.readthedocs.io/) has recently been updated. You are **strongly encouraged** to go through this carefully, it will really help you get the most of the workshop, and will ensure the sessions runs as smoothly as possible.

- Please find an updated version of the programme below.

- You will be given **access to all the slides** from the workshop in PDF format on the day.

- Finally, we are proud to announce that [QMenta](https://www.qmenta.com/) are supporting our workshop, and will **sponsor our Saturday Night social event**! This should be a great opportunity to get to know each other, and for you to 'pick our brains' in a more informal, relaxed setting. See below for more information about [QMenta](https://www.qmenta.com/).

See you all very soon,
The _MRtrix3_ team

> The QMENTA platform provides a unified solution for neuroimaging data management, processing, and visualization. Our straightforward Software Development Kit (SDK) allows researchers to plug-in, share, and run their own tools & workflows on a secure cloud infrastructure. 
>
>Running tools on QMENTA provides virtually infinite computational resources that can adapt to any project and remove the need of maintaining a local cluster, largely reducing the overall cost. Incorporating your neuroimaging tools on the QMENTA platform enables translation of your research work into a product ready to be used in hospitals or clinical trials via a very simple user interface and in a compliant environment that QMENTA platform provides (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA 21 CFR Part 11 & 820, Annex 11 and IEC 62304).
