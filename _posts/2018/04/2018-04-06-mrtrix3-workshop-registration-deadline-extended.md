Hi everyone, 

Some of you will have noticed that the original deadline for registration to the _MRtrix3_ workshop (1 April) has been and gone. However, there are still some places left, so we have now extended the registration deadline for another month. 

Registrations **will now close on Tuesday 1 May, midnight CET.**
Book now to avoid disappointment! 

All the best,

The _MRtrix3_ team
