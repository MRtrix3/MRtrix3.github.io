Hi to all MRtrix3 users! 

I just wanted to share some resources with you: At this year's MICCAI conference, there was a [contest on the best tutorial](http://www.miccai.org/edu/mec.html). For that, I wrote a step-by-step tutorial on MRtrix3, which explains how you analyze raw multi-shell DWI data. In there, you'll learn how to:

1. preprocess the data, and get some idea of what the purpose of each of the analysis steps is,
2. create a whole-brain tractogram and filter out specific tracts of interest, 
3. create a structural connectivity matrix,
4. use the connectome visualization tool.  

Additionally, I'm providing tutorial data â€“ both the raw dicom data as well as any files which are to be created throughout the tutorial. Throughout the tutorial, I'm providing example code which can be directly used on that test data.

If you want to find out more, just visit the OSF tutorial website: [https://osf.io/fkyht/](https://osf.io/fkyht/)

Thanks and enjoy,

Marlene.
