Hi all, 

Just a quick reminder that registrations for our [upcoming workshop in Paris](http://www.mrtrix.org/2018/01/30/announcing-the-first-mrtrix3-workshop-paris-june-22-24/) will **close on Sunday 1 April at midnight CET**. There are still places available, but if you're interested in coming, please register before the deadline!

All the best from the _MRtrix3_ team!
