We are pleased to announce the immediate release of *MRtrix* `3.0.7`.

This is a bug fix release, fixing a couple of issues that have become apparent since the release of version `3.0.5`. We recommend users upgrade as soon as practical, using the instructions provided on our [downloads pages ](https://www.mrtrix.org/download/) (for precompiled packages), or the [usual procedure ](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.5/installation/build_from_source.html) for installations from source.

Note that we had released version `3.0.6` recently, but since further issues came to light soon after, we decided to fix those issues quickly and release this version. We recommend anyone who has recently installed versions `3.0.5` or `3.0.6` upgrade to `3.0.7` as soon as possible. 

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/releases/tag/3.0.7) for details.

All the best from the *MRtrix3* team!
