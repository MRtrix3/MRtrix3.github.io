We are pleased to announce the immediate release of *MRtrix* `3.0.8`.

This is a bug fix release, fixing some long-standing issues with MRView on macOS, as well as a couple of issues that have become apparent since the release of the previous version. We recommend users upgrade as soon as practical, using the instructions provided on our [downloads pages ](https://www.mrtrix.org/download/) (for precompiled packages), or the [usual procedure ](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.8/installation/build_from_source.html) for installations from source.

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/releases/tag/3.0.8) for details.

All the best from the *MRtrix3* team!
