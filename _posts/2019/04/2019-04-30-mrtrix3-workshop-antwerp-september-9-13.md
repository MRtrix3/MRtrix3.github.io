- **cost:**   €500 / 750 / 1000 per person for student / academic / industry attendees. This will include venue hire, coffee breaks, lunches, and a welcome dinner, but will  *exclude*  accommodation.This 4½ day hands-on workshop will cover the theory and practice of diffusion analysis, covering the range of techniques available within _MRtrix3_. 

Participants will each be provided with a laptop, pre-installed with the relevant software and data. Participants who wish to bring their own laptops or data are of course welcome to do so, and we will do our best to accommodate them. 

**After completing this _MRtrix3_ course, participants should be able to process, analyze, and visualize their own diffusion MRI data sets using _MRtrix3_ tools.**
