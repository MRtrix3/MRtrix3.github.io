Hi everyone,

We are pleased to announce that will be hosting our second official _MRtrix3_ workshop in September in Antwerp, Belgium. While we are currently finalising the details of the event, we are making the announcement now to allow potential attendees to plan ahead. We will make a more official announcement in the next few weeks, at which point users will be able to register.

In the meantime, the current plan is:

- **date & time:**  9am Monday 9 till 2pm Friday 13 September 2019 
- **location:**  University of Antwerp, in [the old town of Antwerp](https://goo.gl/maps/xAqLtzLoGMw), Belgium.
- **attendance:**  60-80 delegates
- **cost:**  _predicted_ to be â‚¬600 / 800 / 1000 for per person for student / academic / industry attendees. This will include venue hire, coffee breaks, lunches, and a welcome dinner, but will _exclude_ accommodation.

We hope to see many of you there! Watch this space for further announcements. All the best,

The  *MRtrix3*  team.
