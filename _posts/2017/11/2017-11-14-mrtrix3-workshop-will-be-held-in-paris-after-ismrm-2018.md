Hi everyone, 

We are pleased to announce that will be hosting our first official _MRtrix3_ workshop after next year's ISMRM in Paris. While details of the venue are yet to be confirmed, we are making the announcement now to allow potential attendees to include this in their travel plans for ISMRM. We will make a more official announcement in the next few weeks once the final details are settled, at which point users will be able to register. 

In the meantime, the current plan is:

- **date & time:** 9am Friday 22 June till 1pm Sunday 24 June
- **location:** to be decided, but it will hopefully be close to the main ISMRM conference site (Paris Porte de Versailles)
- **attendance:** 60-80 delegates
- **cost:** approx. â‚¬500 per person. This will include venue hire and 3 lunches, but will _exclude_ accommodation. 

We hope to see many of you there! Watch this space for further announcements. 
All the best,

The _MRtrix3_ team.
